# Spaceship Titanic - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my work for the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) classification competition on Kaggle.

##  Result
- Final Ranking: 145th out of 2,223 teams (Leaderboard, April 30, 2025)
- Model: stacking (LightGBM + XGBoost + CatBoost)
- Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

##  Overview
The task was to predict whether passengers were transported to another dimension during a spaceship incident, based on features like age, home planet, and spending data.

##  Approach
- Feature engineering (handling missing values, combining features)
- Model training with cross-validation
- Ensemble methods for improved performance

##  Files
- `notebooks/SpaceshipTitanic.ipynb`: Clean and final model


##  Note
This competition was useful to practice classification, feature engineering, and model ensembling.
